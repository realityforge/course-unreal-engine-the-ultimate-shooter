# Introduction 

This is just a copy of the populer LinterV2 plugin on Unreal Engine Marketplace - https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/linter-v2.

This is updated to work for UE5.  I will keep updating it for myself and posting updates here. This will remain public until someone asks me to take it down

# Getting Started

Go to the [tags](https://dev.azure.com/thedigitalsages/Unreal%20Engine%20Plugins/_git/ue5-linter/tags) section of this repo and download the repo.  Once you download it, put the contents of this repo in

`GameProject/Plugins/Linter`

One thing to note, you will have to compile your poject via Visual Studio, Rider or VS Code.  

# Issues

Unfortunately Azure Dev Ops doesn't have a robust issue tracker for public projects. If you have an issue, just open a PR or send me an email and I'll get to it
